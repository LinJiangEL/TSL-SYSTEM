<TSL-SYSTEM Tools> %Mathematics@basic, The TSL-SYSTEM Mathematics Tool's Basic Calculations Module.
Usage: IDENTIFY/SYMBOL [ARGUMENTS]
Examples: add 1,2
          div 3,9
          sqrt 8

A module which can provide most of basic calculations for users.

Symbols:
    add a,b        Add two operands.
    sub a,b        Subtract two operands.
    mul a,b        Multiply two operands.
    div a,b        Divide two operands.
    mod a,b        Return the modulus of the operands.
    pow x,a        Return 'x' to the 'a' power.
    abs x          Return the absolute value of the operand 'x'.
    sqr x          Return the square of the operand.
    sqrt x[,y]     Return the 'y' root of 'x'. [y, OPTIONAL, default: 2]
    fdiv a,b       Return the result of the divisible operands.

Arguments Options:
    a,             It is a operand which must follow <Operands Format Rule>.
    b,             It is a operand which must follow <Operands Format Rule>.
    x,             It is a operand which must follow <Operands Format Rule>.
    y,             It is a operand which must follow <Operands Format Rule>.

Identifies:
    @help,         Print this HelpPage.
    @exit,         Exit Mathematics tool, and it will return to ExecuteShell if
                   it got 'True', otherwise it will return to Terminal.
    @flush,        Flush the module buffer.

<Operands Format Rule>
  1. The operand cannot contain characters other than Arabic Numerals.
  2. The expected decimal places should be less than 8.
  3. If there are two operands, they should be separated by ',',
     and there can be no other characters between them.
  4. If there are two or more groups of operands to be operated on,
     they should be separated by spaces. [Still Under Development.]

<Result Format>
  1. The output of 'Result (2)' has two decimal precision.
  2. The output of 'Digits (SYSTEM_DIGMAX)' has decimal precision specified by the sysconfig.
     [SYSTEM_DIGMAX, default: 8]
  3. The output of "Fraction" is "None" by default, except for calculation similar to division.
  4. The output of "Sqrt" is "None" by default, except for calculation similar to radical formula.
